# Description
This project uses a basic Kalman Filter to track the pointer on an OpenCV window based on noisy measurements of mouse coordinates, written in scratch via Python.

# Requirements
> * numpy 1.18.1
> * opencv-python 4.3.0

`kalman.py` defines the general purpose Kalman Filter class.
